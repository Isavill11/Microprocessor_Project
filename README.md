## Starting Out
1. First, download csv dataset from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+Sensor+Array+Drift+Dataset
2. Run the 'add_air_quality.py' file to make a label column with the type of air quality that's specified for that data.
3. You will get an updated dataset. After this, you can run 'value_counts.py' to view the label data.
4. Run the ' model.py' file to train and test the Decision Tree model.
5. This model will be saved to a .h file afterwards, so you will be able to use it for new data later.

## Future updates: 
- Collect new data from sensors to check air quality using a decision tree.
- Remove features to see if we can get air quality with a smaller dataset/fewer sensors. Compute confidence levels.
- Implement the model on an 8051 microcontroller or Raspberry Pi for a TinyML model.
